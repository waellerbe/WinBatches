Run these files with Administrative privileges on your Windows environment.

**SetupWorkingTable.bat** - This script will track user working days via Windows user logon and logoff in group policy. After running this script, go to the directory "User Configuration\Windows Settings\Scripts (Logon/Logoff)" and add files in logon/logoff properties. This will produce a table created with this script located in the user documents folder.

**VirtualWiFi.bat** - This script will create a virtual wifi access point. Look inside the file in order to change the name, and password of the wifi access point.
